# Old Data Science Projects

This is a repository for some old DS projects (mainly notebooks) to keep track of them in an organized manner and serve as a short portfolio.

They are currently divided in two main categories: 
* **kaggle:** Dumps from Kaggle kernels (mainly competitions)
* **other:** External datasets

In all cases, the data is never uploaded so cloning the repo doesn't directly make the notebooks reproducible because for each project the `data/` folder is missing.
