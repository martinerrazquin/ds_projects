# Old Data Science Projects

This is a repository for some old DS projects (mainly notebooks) to keep track of them in an organized manner and serve as a short portfolio.

They are currently divided in two main categories: 
* **kaggle:** Dumps from Kaggle kernels (mainly competitions)
* **other:** External datasets

In all cases, the data is never uploaded so cloning the repo doesn't directly make the notebooks reproducible because for each project the `data/` folder is missing.

## Note on GitHub-displayed Notebooks

The GitHub display for Jupyter Notebooks has trouble showing some outputs, e.g. anything that goes through print. Thus, I highly recommend you copy the link of the notebook and instead use [Jupyter's NBViewer](https://nbviewer.org/) to render them correctly.

For example, [this](https://nbviewer.org/github/martinerrazquin/old_projects/blob/main/other/meli2021/base_estimators.ipynb) is how the MeLi 2021 `base_estimators.ipynb` actually looks like.
